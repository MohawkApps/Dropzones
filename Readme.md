## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`
3. Run `rake pod:install`
4. Run `rake`
5. The simulator should launch automatically.

*Some features - like iMessage sending requires that you run it on an actual device. Building RubyMotion apps to a device is out of  the scope of this readme.*
